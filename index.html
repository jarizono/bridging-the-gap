                        Even though women have been <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/11/18/us-women-are-outpacing-men-in-college-completion-including-in-every-major-racial-and-ethnic-group/" target="_blank">outpacing men</a> in higher education enrollment and completion since 1995 and increasingly participating in the labor force, 
                        they are still severely underrepresented in the tech sector. 
                        According to the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-gender-gap-report-2024/digest/" target="_blank">World Economic Forum</a>, in 2024, women globally made up 47.3% of the non-STEM workforce but only 28.2% of the STEM workforce. 
                        Part of this is due to a lack of representation in the field, which can negatively impact personal motivation and self-efficacy from childhood.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This issue is further compounded in urban schools like those in Atlanta where a lack of resources and funding often deprives its students of the 
                        opportunity to explore tech curriculars in early education, 
                        mainly affecting low-income students of color.</p>
                    <p>
                        In an industry that relies on innovation to serve a varied user base, it is crucial to foster inclusivity. 
                        And it is inexcusable that in a city as diverse and technologically advancing as Atlanta, its own residents are being neglected.

                        Our proposed program solution, "Bridging the Gap" has three goals: to increase access to and interest in STEM, 
                        to connect young girls with mentors and role models, and to measure program success by monitoring future STEM course enrollment. 
                        Participants will be paired with Georgia Tech student volunteers to learn coding, create projects, and form positive relationships. 
                        This program ultimately aims to be a free and flexible opportunity for girls to explore tech in a safe and nonjudgmental space.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Though similar STEM programs exist, especially through CEISMC, program fees can be unaffordable and scholarships are limited. 
                        "Bridging the Gap" strives to be completely free for the participant with the potential of subsidizing for food and transport as well. 
                        This can be achieved by relying on free, online coding programs like Scratch, CodePen, Glitch, W3Schools, and/or TinkerCAD and student volunteers. 
                        If a participant does not have access to a device, the Georgia Tech Library allows Georgia Tech students to borrow a laptop for up to 24 hours, 
                        which would be available to their mentor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        More traditionally structured programs can also be inaccessible for students who or have parents/guardians who work during the day and on weekends. 
                        Additionally, a major criticism of the Girls Who Code Mentoring Corps initiative is that it is difficult to foster lasting and substantial 
                        connections during the schoolyear. Thus, a summer program is perfect as participants and mentors will have fewer academic responsibilities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Pairing them up one-on-one with a mentor can encourage closer relationships while also allowing the program to be centered around their 
                        learning and availability. Though this may limit program enrollment, it may be the most sustainable for its pilot, 
                        though program scaling can always be discussed later, likely based on these initial findings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If substantial funding can be acquired, it will likely be distributed firstly towards making the program as affordable as possible and 
                        secondly towards compensating mentors and any potential training.

                        Though not formalized, this program aims to address the intersectionality between gender, race, and socioeconomic background and it may consider establishing more definite partnerships with the following schools in Atlanta:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Coretta Scott King Young Womenâ€™s Leadership Academy</li>
                        <li>Benjamin E. Mays High School</li>
                        <li> South Atlanta High School</li>
                        <li>Booker T. Washington High School</li>
                        <li>KIPP Atlanta Collegiate</li>
                        <li>D.M. Therrell High School</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, since it can be considered nearly a reformatting of the current Girls Who Code mentorship program, it may rely on GT GWC volunteers and resources, such as the College Loops Fund.

                    This project would not be possible without people interested in it, whether as a learner or mentor. Please consider taking part to bridge the gap and create a more inclusive world. Thank you.
